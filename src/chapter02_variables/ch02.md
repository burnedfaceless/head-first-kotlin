# Chapter 2 - Kotlin's Basic Types and Variables

## Variables

````kotlin
// immutable - cannot be reassigned
val name = "Brian"
// can be reassigned
var x = 2
x = 4
````
- The kotlin compiler can infer the type, or it can be explicitly set
- A variable will retain its type forever

## Kotlin's Basic Types

### Integers

- Kotlin has three basic integer types - **Byte, Short, Int, Long**
- `val x = 1` assigns an integer
- A number that is larger than an integer will be stored as a long, as will
  numbers where you add the `l` or `L` suffix

````kotlin
var hugeNumber = 6L
````

| **Type** | **Bits** | **Value Range**|
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Byte** | 8 Bits   |-128 to 127     |
| **Short** |16 Bits   |-32768 to 32767 |
| **Int**  |32 Bits  |-2147483648 to 21476483647|
|**Long**  | 64 Bits  | -huge to (huge - 1) |

### Floating Point (Decimal) Numbers

- Kotlin has two basic floating-point types: **Float**, and **Double**
- Floats can hold 32 bits, while Doubles can hold 64 bits
- Default data type for floating point numbers is Double

````kotlin
// assigns a double
var x = 123.5
// assigns a float
var x = 123.5F
````

### Booleans

````kotlin
var isBarking = true
var isTrained = false
````

### Characters and Strings

````kotlin
// char - store a single character 
var letter = 'D'
// string
var name = "Fido"
````

### How to explicitly declare a variable's type

````kotlin
// explicitly set the type
var smallNum: Short
var tinyNum: Byte

// declare variable and assign value (i.e. initialize)
var z: Short = 6
````

### Converting From One Type To Another

- Numbers in Kotlin appear to be an object, whereas in Java they are primitives

````kotlin
var x = 5
var z: Long = x.toLong()
````
